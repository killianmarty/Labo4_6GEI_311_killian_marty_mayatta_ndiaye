\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}X-Forwarded-For Proxy Fix
=========================

This module provides a middleware that adjusts the WSGI environ based on
``X-Forwarded-`` headers that proxies in front of an application may
set.

When an application is running behind a proxy server, WSGI may see the
request as coming from that server rather than the real client. Proxies
set various headers to track where the request actually came from.

This middleware should only be used if the application is actually
behind such a proxy, and should be configured with the number of proxies
that are chained in front of it. Not all proxies set all the headers.
Since incoming headers can be faked, you must set how many proxies are
setting each header so the middleware knows what to trust.
