\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Application Dispatcher
======================

This middleware creates a single WSGI application that dispatches to
multiple other WSGI applications mounted at different URL paths.

A common example is writing a Single Page Application, where you have a
backend API and a frontend written in JavaScript that does the routing
in the browser rather than requesting different pages from the server.
The frontend is a single HTML and JS file that should be served for any
path besides "/api".

This example dispatches to an API app under "/api", an admin app
under "/admin", and an app that serves frontend files for all other
requests::

    app = DispatcherMiddleware(serve_frontend, {
        '/api': api_app,
        '/admin': admin_app,
    })

In production, you might instead handle this at the HTTP server level,
serving files or proxying to application servers based on location. The
API and admin apps would each be deployed with a separate WSGI server,
and the static files would be served directly by the HTTP server.
